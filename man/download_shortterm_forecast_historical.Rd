}
\arguments{
\item{latitude}{numeric, latitude in decimal format of the location of interest.
As the API mostly uses gridded data, it could be that it forwards data of a slightly
different coordinate}

\item{longitude}{numeric, longitude in decimal format of the location of interest.
As the API mostly uses gridded data, it could be that it forwards data of a slightly
different coordinate}

\item{var}{numeric, by default set to 'temperature_2m'. Specifies the weather variable
that should be downloaded.}

\item{start_date}{character, date in a format 'yyyy-mm-dd'}

\item{end_date}{character, date in a format 'yyyy-mm-dd'. The total period shoul
no exceed 16 days}

\item{base_url}{character, url of the API client}

\item{params}{list, by default NULL. This argument allows the user to make
customized requests. The format need to be named. Check the website for element
names and values. If specified, other arguements apart of base_url are ignored}
}
\value{
data.frame containing the columns:
Date, Year, Month, Day, Hour, Var, Unit, latitude, longitude.
Most columns are self-explanatory. Var contains the requested variable,
Unit specifies in what unit it is provided. latitude and longitude
specify the pixels coordinate the data is taken from, so it may differ
#from the originally requested coordinates
}
\description{
Access the Weather Forecast API (https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-forecast-api) and
downloads forecasted temperature (or any other variable you specify) for a period
up to sixteen days. This function makes great use of the
download_shortterm_forecast function of the same package. Historical forecast
are available since 2022.
}
\details{
The API collects forecasts from many weather agencies and weather models.
You can find more information on their website.

You can eihter make pre-defined data requests by specifying latitude,
longitude, but you can also customize your request. Customized request
need to supplied in a named list format under the parameter: params.
Check the website for the request element names and values.

For example you can request other weather variables, e.g. precipitation,
or you can request data to be in a daily format instead of hourly. You could
also request data from a certain weather model.
